# Clojure Mode

Provides Emacs font-lock, indentation, and navigation for the
[Clojure programming language](http://clojure.org).

A more thorough walkthrough is available at [clojure-doc.org](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html)

## Installation

Available on both [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/clojure-mode) and
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) repos.

Marmalade is recommended as it has the latest stable version, but
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

If you're not already using Marmalade, add this to your
`~/.emacs.d/init.el` and load it with <kbd>M-x eval-buffer</kbd>.

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
```

If you're feeling adventurous and you'd like to use MELPA add this bit
of code instead:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```

And then you can install:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] clojure-mode [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'clojure-mode)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'clojure-mode))
```

On Emacs 23 you will need to get [package.el](http://bit.ly/pkg-el23)
yourself or install manually by placing `clojure-mode.el` on your `load-path`
and `require`ing it.

## Clojure Test Mode

This source repository also includes `clojure-test-mode.el`, which
provides support for running Clojure tests (using the `clojure.test`
framework) via nrepl.el and seeing feedback in the test buffer about
which tests failed or errored. The installation instructions above
should work for clojure-test-mode as well.

Once you have a repl session active, you can run the tests in the
current buffer with <kbd>C-c C-,</kbd>. Failing tests and errors will be
highlighted using overlays. To clear the overlays, use <kbd>C-c k</kbd>.

You can jump between implementation and test files with <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> if
your project is laid out in a way that clojure-test-mode expects. Your project
root should have a `src/` directory containing files that correspond to their
namespace. It should also have a `test/` directory containing files that
correspond to their namespace, and the test namespaces should mirror the
implementation namespaces with the addition of "-test" as the suffix to the last
segment of the namespace.

So `my.project.frob` would be found in `src/my/project/frob.clj` and its tests
would be in `test/my/project/frob_test.clj` in the `my.project.frob-test`
namespace.

This behavior can also be overridden by setting `clojure-test-for-fn` and
`clojure-test-implementation-for-fn` with functions of your choosing.
`clojure-test-for-fn` takes an implementation namespace and returns the full
path of the test file.  `clojure-test-implementation-for-fn` takes a test
namespace and returns the full path for the implementation file.

## Paredit

Using clojure-mode with
[Paredit](http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el) is highly
recommended. It helps ensure the structure of your forms is not
compromised and offers a number of operations that work on code
structure at a higher level than just characters and words.

It is also available using package.el from the above archives.

Use Paredit as you normally would any other minor mode; for instance:

```lisp
;; (require 'paredit) if you didn't install it via package.el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'paredit-mode)
```

See [the cheat sheet](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PareditCheatsheet)
for Paredit usage hints.

## REPL Interaction

A number of options exist for connecting to a running Clojure process
and evaluating code interactively.

### Basic REPL

Use <kbd>M-x run-lisp</kbd> to open a simple REPL subprocess using
[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Once that has
opened, you can use <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> to evaluate the region or
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> to load the whole file.

If you don't use Leiningen, you can set `inferior-lisp-program` to
a different REPL command.

### nrepl.el

You can also use [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) to start an
enhanced REPL via [nrepl.el](https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el).

### Ritz

Another option is [Ritz](https://github.com/pallet/ritz), which is a
bit more complicated but offers advanced debugging functionality using
SLIME.

### Swank Clojure

SLIME is available via
[swank-clojure](http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure) in `clojure-mode` 1.x.
SLIME support was removed in version 2.x in favor of `nrepl.el`.

# Clojure Mode

Provides Emacs font-lock, indentation, and navigation for the
[Clojure language](http://clojure.org).

## Installation

Available on both [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/clojure-mode) and
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) repos.

The latest stable version of `clojure-mode` is available on Marmalade.

If you're not already using Marmalade, add this to your
`~/.emacs.d/init.el` and load it with `M-x eval-buffer`.

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
```

The version of `clojure-mode` on MELPA is a development snapshot that
might contain more bugs that usual or experimental work and features
in progress. Use it at your own risk!

If you're feeling adventurous and you'd like to use MELPA add this bit
of code instead:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```

And then you can install:

`M-x package-install [RET] clojure-mode [RET]`

or

```lisp
(when (not (package-installed-p 'clojure-mode))
  (package-install 'clojure-mode))
```

On Emacs 23 you will need to get [package.el](http://bit.ly/pkg-el23)
yourself or install manually by placing `clojure-mode.el` on your `load-path`
and `require`ing it.

## Clojure Test Mode

This source repository also includes `clojure-test-mode.el`, which
provides support for running Clojure tests (using the `clojure.test`
framework) via nrepl.el or SLIME and seeing feedback in the test
buffer about which tests failed or errored. The installation
instructions above should work for clojure-test-mode as well.
(nrepl.el support is still in progress.)

Once you have a repl session active, you can run the tests in the
current buffer with `C-c C-,`. Failing tests and errors will be
highlighted using overlays. To clear the overlays, use `C-c k`.

You can jump between implementation and test files with `C-c C-t` if
your project is laid out in a way that clojure-test-mode expects. Your
project root should have a `src/` directory containing files that
correspond to their namespace. It should also have a `test/` directory
containing files that correspond to their namespace, and the test
namespaces should mirror the implementation namespaces with the
addition of "-test" as the suffix to the last segment of the namespace.

So `my.project.frob` would be found in `src/my/project/frob.clj` and
its tests would be in `test/my/project/frob_test.clj` in the
`my.project.frob-test` namespace.

## Paredit

Using clojure-mode with paredit is highly recommended. It is also
available using package.el from the above archive.

Use paredit as you normally would with any other mode; for instance:

```lisp
;; (require 'paredit) if you didn't install via package.el
(defun turn-on-paredit () (paredit-mode 1))
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'turn-on-paredit)
```

See [the cheat sheet](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PareditCheatsheet)
for paredit usage hints.

## REPL Interaction

A number of options exist for connecting to a running Clojure process
and evaluating code interactively.

## Basic REPL

Use <kbd>M-x run-lisp</kbd> to open a simple REPL subprocess using
[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Once that has
opened, you can use <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> to evaluate the region or
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> to load the whole file.

If you don't use Leiningen, you can set `inferior-lisp-program` to
a different REPL command.

## nrepl.el

You can also use [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) to start an
enhanced REPL via [nrepl.el](https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el).

## Ritz

Another option is [Ritz](https://github.com/pallet/ritz), which is a
bit more complicated but offers advanced debugging functionality using
SLIME.

## Swank Clojure

SLIME is available via
[swank-clojure](http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure) in `clojure-mode` 1.x.
SLIME support was removed in version 2.x in favor of `nrepl.el`.
